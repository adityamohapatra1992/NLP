       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Tumbbad<br/><br/>With this movie , indian film making has definitely gained a certain level of maturity . I have lost my faith in horror cum thriller zone movies which are produced in india, in past all they do is cut copy paste. This movie is definitely original. They do not use sudden creepy sound effects or the old tricks of moving camera over the shoulder. The director completely relies on the story to work and it works. The camera lenses are well used to portray the claustrophobic scenes . The production value is top notch , totally uplifts the movie. Most of the scene includes rain , the greens and a dark environment which works superbly . Director duo do not try to scare you through formula film making methods. They don't even try to do that ,it's the story and the environment which worked for them. Most of the scenes are designed in low light conditions but the contrast is high enough to attract your eye's attention towards the character. Actors have pulled there character successfully specially Soham Shah who is also the producer.\n",
       " A thousand year old myth , greed, deep dark corner of a humen's psyche , a monster (within and out too), ajay atul's precise background score , the spellbound scenic value and a world class direction . There is so much more this movie has to offer. The masala movie watcher may not able to appreciate the movie as it must be but this movie definitely deserves a sensible class of audience.</div>\n",

       "The story is based on the spooky Indian mythology/horror folktale of a demon who is loaded with gold but deprived of food.\n",
       "One family has been able to revive the demon by building a temple inside an isolated n creepy mansion. Cos of this the family is ostracised.\n",
       "The mansion is huge with big doors n fort like walls n only the old father resides in the mansion. The wife/mistress do visit the mansion everyday to give the old husband a hand-job n while she gives him the hand-job, she asks him to hurry up, to which the oldie replies in a funny way. The wife also inquires about a gold coin which is kept near the demon's idol.\n",

       "The cinematographer did a fantastic job in creating a perpetual and palpable sense of tension and fear.\n",
       "The director also did a nice job of building a concrete, hypnotizing story without ever having to sacrifice pacing.\n",
       "The story takes place in a span of thirty years n the details r appropriately handled.\n",

       "Attention has been paid in the local ethnic details, the time period, costumes n architecture.\n",
       "Also the moral subject of greed n lust were handled very well. The subject of Sati n female subjugation were sprinkled but not explored.\n",

Sohum Shah, take a bow. Whoever did the VFX and Makeup deserves all the awards. The story is so original and I felt the eerie atmosphere throughout the movie. Also, today's bollywood movies often try to show as much brightness in every scene. The fact that the cinematography of this film is so awesome, that it's dark, in the rain, just immerses you in the plot and the 1900s. I heard it took 6 years of hard work. Thank you for giving the Indian audience this amazing film. A big step for the future of Indian cinema</div>\n",

       "Instead there is a corrupt feudal lord who exploits a widow, bribing her with gold coins. But when its time to reward her, all he says is\"swarn mudra kamaani padti hai.\" You realise the truth of this statement later in the movie.\n",
       "Instead of righteous protagonist, we have Vinayak who is greedy for wealth which he feels belongs to him. But then he is told, \"Virasat mein mili har cheez par dawa nahi karte.\" He craves for the treasure and fights his fears and finally reaches to it. And boy!!! Once you see how he earns it..you will feel he definitely deserves it. \n",
       "Now for the acting part...Sohum Shah absolutely nailed the role of Vinayak. He has very few dialogues but his eyes do the talking. From lecherous to vengeful in a flash.\n",
       "And now coming to the main hero of the movie...the sets!!! It was hypnotic and beyond words!! The pre independence era has been captured beautifully and to the tee. The walls..the grey canvas...and my favorite part..the locks!! Oh..they just take you back in time.\n",
       "Finally..in one line...Go and watch this movie.It is an experience you will take back home with you. A story that will stay will you to tease you and taunt you.</div>\n",

His encounter with a wretched old lady who knows of a buried treasure sets him on the path to greed. He grows up to explore the local legend of a monster named Hastar and his gold medallions. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The best form of horror is one which plays with your mind. The fear of the uncertain and the unknown is what evokes the strongest emotions. Tumbbad is a perfect example of a film that creates a surreal illusion. This psychological horror has its traditional moments of blood and gore, but the most promising part of this terrifying fable is that it makes monsters out of ordinary men. A greedy human can be a lot more malicious than a cursed supernatural entity. <br/><br/>Ideas like that make Tumbbad a real mind-bender and the film's top-notch production design makes it a movie that truly reinvents the horror genre for Indian cinema.<br/><br/>\n",
       "The film kicks off with a CGI sequence of gods and goddesses and a strong allegory of the destructive nature of greed. <br/><br/>Tumbbad, an actual village in Maharashtra, becomes the fabric of this tale. <br/><br/>Tumbbad is a moody and atmospheric film. Some viewers may find the film a little too deep and disturbing, but fans of Hollywood horror films will be reminded of memorable movies in the genre. <br/><br/>This one is genuinely scary.</div>\n",

Though watched it at its initial screening at the Venice festival but writing this review after re-watch again.<br/><br/>Story about greed that start from an ancient treasure hidden in a mansion. The process of reaching to that wealth and the desire to grab more of it and in the process going to any extent. I'll sum this movie in these couple of lines not giving the entire story and the plot. <br/><br/>It has some Excellent background score and gripping screenplay. Does have some minor flaws that can be ignored. Overall, original story and folklore make it a worthy watch with a superlative effort from the actor and producer Soham Shah. Enjoy almost two hours of adventure with a seasoning of Horror and you will not be disappointed. Did read some weird reviews from critics mentioning it \" as an art film\" not for everybody and some even mentioning \" it has a lot of Marathi influence and Hindi speaking audience might not like it \" very sad Indeed. My request please do watch it.</div>\n",

       " \"TumbbadWith this movie , indian film making has definitely gained a certain level of maturity . I have lost my faith in horror cum thriller zone movies which are produced in india, in past all they do is cut copy paste. This movie is definitely original. They do not use sudden creepy sound effects or the old tricks of moving camera over the shoulder. The director completely relies on the story to work and it works. The camera lenses are well used to portray the claustrophobic scenes . The production value is top notch , totally uplifts the movie. Most of the scene includes rain , the greens and a dark environment which works superbly . Director duo do not try to scare you through formula film making methods. They don't even try to do that ,it's the story and the environment which worked for them. Most of the scenes are designed in low light conditions but the contrast is high enough to attract your eye's attention towards the character. Actors have pulled there character successfully specially Soham Shah who is also the producer.\\n A thousand year old myth , greed, deep dark corner of a humen's psyche , a monster (within and out too), ajay atul's precise background score , the spellbound scenic value and a world class direction . There is so much more this movie has to offer. The masala movie watcher may not able to appreciate the movie as it must be but this movie definitely deserves a sensible class of audience.\",\n",

The camera lenses are well used to portray the claustrophobic scenes . The production value is top notch , totally uplifts the movie. Most of the scene includes rain , the greens and a dark environment which works superbly . Director duo do not try to scare you through formula film making methods. They don't even try to do that ,it's the story and the environment which worked for them.

He grows up to explore the local legend of a monster named Hastar and his gold medallions. The best form of horror is one which plays with your mind. The fear of the uncertain and the unknown is what evokes the strongest emotions. Tumbbad is a perfect example of a film that creates a surreal illusion. This psychological horror has its traditional moments of blood and gore, but the most promising part of this terrifying fable is that it makes monsters out of ordinary men. A greedy human can be a lot more malicious than a cursed supernatural entity. Ideas like that make Tumbbad a real mind-bender and the film's top-notch production design makes it a movie that truly reinvents the horror genre for Indian cinema.\\nThe film kicks off with a CGI sequence of gods and goddesses and a strong allegory of the destructive nature of greed. Tumbbad, an actual village in Maharashtra, becomes the fabric of this tale. Tumbbad is a moody and atmospheric film. Some viewers may find the film a little too deep and disturbing, but fans of Hollywood horror films will be reminded of memorable movies in the genre. This one is genuinely scary.\",\n",

Whole movie is so beautifully shot no wonder it is shot in natural light and the beauty is visible. This movie is a feast for your eyes with cinematic excellence is on full display. You wouldnt even have time to wander off your mind but watch it with eyes wide open. You won\\'t enjoy it on small screen but have to watch in cinema halls. Mind you this movie took 6 years in making can you believe in the perseverance of the people who clung onto movie for 6 years despite harships.',\n",
       " 'I have to write a review for this spectacular movie, this i consider as my duty as a true movie fan who watches at least ten movies in theaters every month. I would like to congratulate sohum shah for this movie. Each frame of this movie is like an art piece, and the script is so beautiful, they used very few words to describe it. but those words clear all your doubt and also let you think on the story, people who are saying anything against it are morons, this in once in a life time movie. Tumbbad team you are the best.',\n",
       " \"I bet you have never seen anything like this before in bollywood. Don't miss it, its a kind of movie you should watch in movie theatre. Best cinematography best vfx best storytelling.\",\n",
       " 'This movie is great,has eye catched VFX, Great & Original Story line ..\\nThis kind of cinema should be appriciate by indian audience becuase this kind of movie should be made..& this is only possible if Indian Audiences welcome this kind of different & intellectual & Great cinema ..Hatts of to the Producer.. This movie does not do well in box office & the biggest reason behind this is the Taste of Indian cinema that is so poor & the Movie is very rich in every way.....must watch movie..',\n",
       " \"This was something that may give may give 'goosebumps' to the makers of Hollywood movies. This is a movie that will add to the Indian cinema a tons but unfortunately Indian cinema is not prepared for it. The viewers are not prepared for it. We are still into watching that regular melodrama and item songs.\\nI was fantasized for the making of Stree and acting and drama that made it. But after watching this I can proudly appreciate the concept and depth that this movie offers. This shows us what a thriller can be like. The biggest attraction of the movie was the story that was very symbolic of the human craving. Human craving takes you into darkness is the message of the movie .\\nSohum Shah has played his part powerfully and so has Anita Date.\\nThe direction was not orthodox and was original.\\nThis is the first movie of its type and definitely Hollywood can learn from it. This is a much an improvement over the Hollywood stories like Annabelle, Conjuring.\\nA must entertainment for all. Watch it, especially if you are not into watching the regular drama that Indian cinema offers like Race 3\",\n",
       " 'Original stories like Tumbbad are rarely heard forget about made into films. The film is bold,dark,atmospheric and unique. This is movie is not like the horror movies which uses jump scares. Rather it cannot be exactly called a horror movie. It is combination of folk,fantasy, adventure,horror which results into a cult. Kudos to the makers for making this brave film!!',\n",
       " \"This movie is way different than any horror movie ever made in india...it is a perfect blend of mythology, greet, desi atmosphere with exceptional horror.\\nThe story setup here is that there is an evil god lurking deep below a broken-down colonial estate located in the rural village of Tumbbad, who has spent an eternity protecting an infinite stash of gold from those who succumb to their own greedy desires.While it could use a little tightening in terms of its story, Tumbbad is a haunting and timeless exploration of just how badly greed can corrupt any of us, and we see that perfectly embodied in Vinayak's journey throughout the film, where he makes some pretty horrendous decisions because of his need to posture as a respected figure in his small community.\",\n",
       " 'Watch this movie in Theatre warna Race 4 aajayenga.\\nPeople who say Bollywood Mai story Nahi hai content nahi hai now here is the answer\\nWatch Tumbbad in Theatre',\n",
       " 'Finally its here!!! An Indian horror movie with an Indian story and an Indian soul. It has the smell of wet soil..it has the dampness of old house covered with moulds. There are no castles and occulists performing exorcism on white eyed monstrous girl.\\nInstead there is a corrupt feudal lord who exploits a widow, bribing her with gold coins. But when its time to reward her, all he says is\"swarn mudra kamaani padti hai.\" You realise the truth of this statement later in the movie.\\nInstead of righteous protagonist, we have Vinayak who is greedy for wealth which he feels belongs to him. But then he is told, \"Virasat mein mili har cheez par dawa nahi karte.\" He craves for the treasure and fights his fears and finally reaches to it. And boy!!! Once you see how he earns it..you will feel he definitely deserves it. \\nNow for the acting part...Sohum Shah absolutely nailed the role of Vinayak. He has very few dialogues but his eyes do the talking. From lecherous to vengeful in a flash.\\nAnd now coming to the main hero of the movie...the sets!!! It was hypnotic and beyond words!! The pre independence era has been captured beautifully and to the tee. The walls..the grey canvas...and my favorite part..the locks!! Oh..they just take you back in time.\\nFinally..in one line...Go and watch this movie.It is an experience you will take back home with you. A story that will stay will you to tease you and taunt you.',\n",
       " 'A gorgeous looking, intriguing morality tale..\\nAn ancient myth. A hideous demon. Hidden treasure. Human greed. This potent mix is stirred and ground in Tumbbad, and the result is a highly unusual, visually stunning, richly atmospheric concoction of genres and themes',\n",
       " \"I hate indian movies they're garbage just terrible I mean seriously all these singing, dancing and all the dramatic crying they all look the same to me\\nBUT this is the only movie which I liked original screenplay absolutely flawless movie by a genius director I still can't believe this is indian movie highly recommended for horror genre fans\",\n",
       " \"It's about time we saw some quality cinema, Bollywood guys please make movies like this. Get ride of the Khan clan and give new talent a chance. See the guy who acts in this movie. It was such a breath of fresh air.\",\n",
       " \"-----A young boy Vinayak Rao is affected by a personal tragedy. His encounter with a wretched old lady who knows of a buried treasure sets him on the path to greed. He grows up to explore the local legend of a monster named Hastar and his gold medallions. The best form of horror is one which plays with your mind. The fear of the uncertain and the unknown is what evokes the strongest emotions. Tumbbad is a perfect example of a film that creates a surreal illusion. This psychological horror has its traditional moments of blood and gore, but the most promising part of this terrifying fable is that it makes monsters out of ordinary men. A greedy human can be a lot more malicious than a cursed supernatural entity. Ideas like that make Tumbbad a real mind-bender and the film's top-notch production design makes it a movie that truly reinvents the horror genre for Indian cinema.\\nThe film kicks off with a CGI sequence of gods and goddesses and a strong allegory of the destructive nature of greed. Tumbbad, an actual village in Maharashtra, becomes the fabric of this tale. Tumbbad is a moody and atmospheric film. Some viewers may find the film a little too deep and disturbing, but fans of Hollywood horror films will be reminded of memorable movies in the genre. This one is genuinely scary.\",\n",
       " \"Tumbbad is a triumph in Indian cinema for horror/thriller genre. The atmosphere, background score and cinematography all falling into place perfectly for this eerie film to set the mood. It nevers leaves that dreaded and thrilling feeling through out the run of this entire film. \\nWhat an amazing cinematography, I would say. Even hollywood can take inspiration out of this which is making all the same type of horror movies these days with cheap thrills and jumpy scenes with out of the loud soundtrack to scare. \\nThe story is spellbounding and most importantly fresh. It's one of the most important fact of the movie which makes it all the more watchable and intriguing.\\nThumbs up to the director, actor and the cinematographer. Do yourself a favor and watch this masterpiece of Indian cinema.\",\n",
       " \"Must watch.. I just came watching movie and it's too good. I'm still living in Tumbbad even after moving out of theatre..\",\n",
       " 'Extremely horror, eerie and malicious,spooky ride,wont let you sleep at night.',\n",
       " 'Takes Indian horror to next level.\\nyou can see the hard work of cast in movie.\\nall sets looks real.\\nyou can see how star cast removes quality in 2.0 trailer.\\nthis movie will remain in your head whole day after watching.',\n",
       " \"This movie was awesome...after very long time I've seen such a beautiful movie...\",\n",
       " 'TUMBAAD is a highly engrossing movie and a Visual treat. Original Story amidst a backdrop of folklore makes Tumbbad a delight. Though watched it at its initial screening at the Venice festival but writing this review after re-watch again.Story about greed that start from an ancient treasure hidden in a mansion. The process of reaching to that wealth and the desire to grab more of it and in the process going to any extent. I\\'ll sum this movie in these couple of lines not giving the entire story and the plot. It has some Excellent background score and gripping screenplay. Does have some minor flaws that can be ignored. Overall, original story and folklore make it a worthy watch with a superlative effort from the actor and producer Soham Shah. Enjoy almost two hours of adventure with a seasoning of Horror and you will not be disappointed. Did read some weird reviews from critics mentioning it \" as an art film\" not for everybody and some even mentioning \" it has a lot of Marathi influence and Hindi speaking audience might not like it \" very sad Indeed. My request please do watch it.',\n",
       " 'Wow so many reviews!!! All I can say is PART 2 is must..... 1 was not enough... dil maange more!',\n",
       " 'The film is mind-blowing.. The plot is interesting with slight tinge of horror. This shows indian myths have potential to create awesome movies . The direction is worth praising']"

I have lost my faith in horror cum thriller zone movies which are produced in india, in past all they do is cut copy paste. This movie is definitely original. They do not use sudden creepy sound effects or the old tricks of moving camera over the shoulder. The director completely relies on the story to work and it works. The camera lenses are well used to portray the claustrophobic scenes . The production value is top notch , totally uplifts the movie. Most of the scene includes rain , the greens and a dark environment which works superbly . Director duo do not try to scare you through formula film making methods. They don't even try to do that ,it's the story and the environment which worked for them. Most of the scenes are designed in low light conditions but the contrast is high enough to attract your eye's attention towards the character. Actors have pulled there character successfully specially Soham Shah who is also the producer.\\n A thousand year old myth , greed, deep dark corner of a humen's psyche , a monster (within and out too), ajay atul's precise background score , the spellbound scenic value and a world class direction . There is so much more this movie has to offer. The masala movie watcher may not able to appreciate the movie as it must be but this movie definitely deserves a sensible class of audience.\",\n",

They do not use sudden creepy sound effects or the old tricks of moving camera over the shoulder. The director completely relies on the story to work and it works. The camera lenses are well used to portray the claustrophobic scenes . The production value is top notch , totally uplifts the movie. Most of the scene includes rain , the greens and a dark environment which works superbly . Director duo do not try to scare you through formula film making methods. They don't even try to do that ,it's the story and the environment which worked for them. Most of the scenes are designed in low light conditions but the contrast is high enough to attract your eye's attention towards the character.

bite of the demon n the old hag needs to be fed regularly while she is asleep or she might resort to cannibalism the house is a striking image on top a hill reminding viewers of isolation in the countryside there are no close by neighbors as the family is on their own after their ostracisation there was something very trance like feel in this movie especially the weather n the locations the constant rain and vivid well filmed local landscapes were the characters themselves it is dark n claustrophobic with palpable atmosphere the cinematographer did a fantastic job in creating a perpetual and palpable sense of tension and fear the director also did a nice job of building a concrete hypnotizing story without ever having to sacrifice pacing the story takes place in a span of thirty years n the details r appropriately handled if u notice the mansion in the beginning n after fifteen years u will see all the details attention has been paid in the local ethnic details the time period costumes n architecture also the moral subject of greed n lust were handled very well the subject of sati n female subjugation were sprinkled but not explored soham shah was good n the kids were good too appreciate soham n the producers for producing such a good horror film kudos to the director for a fantastic twist ending this movie will definitely be in the conversation of the greatest indian movies ever made years from now people will be referring to this film as an absolute classic and masterpiece in the genre sohum shah take a bow whoever did the vfx and makeup deserves all the awards the story is so original and i felt the eerie atmosphere throughout the movie also today s bollywood movies often try to show as much brightness in every scene the fact that the cinematography of this film is so awesome that it s dark in the rain just immerses you in the plot and the s i heard it took years of hard work thank you for giving the indian audience this amazing film a big step for the future of indian cinema tumbbad is not a common movie it will leave you gripped to your seat making you think what would happen next whole movie is so beautifully shot no wonder it is shot in natural light and the beauty is visible this movie is a feast for your eyes with cinematic excellence is on full display you wouldnt even have time to wander off your mind but watch it with eyes wide open you won t enjoy it on small screen but have to watch in cinema halls mind you this movie took years in making can you believe in the perseverance of the people who clung onto movie for years despite harships we dont deserve movies like tumbbad there is no khan in this movie no item songs and no big stars do yourself a favor by watching tumbbad this week brilliant direction and breathtaking cinematography breaks my heart to see an empty theater on day contribute to meaningful cinema by watching it in theaters or keep complaining about movies like race tumbbadwinninghearts tumbbadwith this movie indian film making has definitely gained a certain level of maturity i have lost my faith in horror cum thriller zone movies which are produced in india in past all they do is cut copy paste this movie is definitely original they do not use sudden creepy sound effects or the old tricks of moving camera over the shoulder the director completely relies on the story to work and it works the camera lenses are well used to portray the claustrophobic scenes the production value is top notch totally uplifts the movie most of the scene includes rain the greens and a dark environment which works superbly director duo do not try to scare you through formula film making methods they don t even try to do that it s the story and the environment which worked for them most of the scenes are designed in low light conditions but the contrast is high enough to attract your eye s attention towards the character actors have pulled there character successfully specially soham shah who is also the producer a thousand year old myth greed deep dark corner of a humen s psyche a monster within and out too ajay atul s precise background score the spellbound scenic value and a world class direction there is so much more this movie has to offer the masala movie watcher may not able to appreciate the movie as it must be but this movie definitely deserves a sensible class of audience the film begins with beautiful cinematography the story is unique bringing mythology n the moral subject of human greed the story is based on the spooky indian mythology horror folktale of a demon who is loaded with gold but deprived of food one family has been able to revive the demon by building a temple inside an isolated n creepy mansion cos of this the family is ostracised the mansion is huge with big doors n fort like walls n only the old father resides in the mansion the wife mistress do visit the mansion everyday to give the old husband a hand job n while she gives him the hand job she

the director for a fantastic twist ending this movie will definitely be in the conversation of the greatest indian movies ever made years from now people will be referring to this film as an absolute classic and masterpiece in the genre sohum shah take a bow whoever did the vfx and makeup deserves all the awards the story is so original and i felt the eerie atmosphere throughout the movie also today s bollywood movies often try to show as much brightness in every scene the fact that the cinematography of this film is so awesome that it s dark in the rain just immerses you in the plot and the s i heard it took years of hard work thank you for giving the indian audience this amazing film a big step for the future of indian cinema tumbbad is not a common movie it will leave you gripped to your seat making you think what would happen next whole movie is so beautifully shot no wonder it is shot in natural light and the beauty is visible this movie is a feast for your eyes with cinematic excellence is on full display you wouldnt even have time to wander off your mind but watch it with eyes wide open you won t enjoy it on small screen but have to watch in cinema halls mind you this movie took years in making can you believe in the perseverance of the people who clung onto movie for years despite harships i have to write a review for this spectacular movie this i consider as my duty as a true movie fan who watches at least ten movies in theaters every month i would like to congratulate sohum shah for this movie each frame of this movie is like an art piece and the script is so beautiful they used very few words to describe it but those words clear all your doubt and also let you think on the story people who are saying anything against it are morons this in once in a life time movie tumbbad team you are the best i bet you have never seen anything like this before in bollywood don t miss it its a kind of movie you should watch in movie theatre best cinematography best vfx best storytelling this movie is great has eye catched vfx great original story line this kind of cinema should be appriciate by indian audience becuase this kind of movie should be made this is only possible if indian audiences welcome this kind of different intellectual great cinema hatts of to the producer this movie does not do well in box office the biggest reason behind this is the taste of indian cinema that is so poor the movie is very rich in every way must watch movie this was something that may give may give goosebumps to the makers of hollywood movies this is a movie that will add to the indian cinema a tons but unfortunately indian cinema is not prepared for it the viewers are not prepared for it we are still into watching that regular melodrama and item songs i was fantasized for the making of stree and acting and drama that made it but after watching this i can proudly appreciate the concept and depth that this movie offers this shows us what a thriller can be like the biggest attraction of the movie was the story that was very symbolic of the human craving human craving takes you into darkness is the message of the movie sohum shah has played his part powerfully and so has anita date the direction was not orthodox and was original this is the first movie of its type and definitely hollywood can learn from it this is a much an improvement over the hollywood stories like annabelle conjuring a must entertainment for all watch it especially if you are not into watching the regular drama that indian cinema offers like race original stories like tumbbad are rarely heard forget about made into films the film is bold dark atmospheric and unique this is movie is not like the horror movies which uses jump scares rather it cannot be exactly called a horror movie it is combination of folk fantasy adventure horror which results into a cult kudos to the makers for making this brave film this movie is way different than any horror movie ever made in india it is a perfect blend of mythology greet desi atmosphere with exceptional horror the story setup here is that there is an evil god lurking deep below a broken down colonial estate located in the rural village of tumbbad who has spent an eternity protecting an infinite stash of gold from those who succumb to their own greedy desires while it could use a little tightening in terms of its story tumbbad is a haunting and timeless exploration of just how badly greed can corrupt any of us and we see that perfectly embodied in vinayak s journey throughout the film where he makes some pretty horrendous decisions because of his need to posture as a respected figure in his small community we dont deserve movies like tumbbad there is no khan in this movie no item songs and no big stars do yourself a favor by watching tumbbad this week brilliant direction and breathtaking cinematography breaks my heart to see an empty theater on day contribute to meaningful cinema by watching it in theaters or keep complaining about movies like race tumbbadwinninghearts tumbbadwith this movie indian film making has definitely gained a certain level of maturity i have lost my faith in horror cum thriller zone movies which are produced in india in past all they do is cut copy paste this movie is definitely original they do not use sudden creepy sound effects or the old tricks of moving camera over the shoulder the director completely relies on the story to work and it works the camera lenses are well used to portray the claustrophobic scenes the production value is top notch totally uplifts the movie most of the scene includes rain the greens and a dark environment which works superbly director duo do not try to scare you through formula film making methods they don t even try to do that it s the story and the environment which worked for them most of the scenes are designed in low light conditions but the contrast is high enough to attract your eye s attention towards the character actors have pulled there character successfully specially soham shah who is also the producer a thousand year old myth greed deep dark corner of a humen s psyche a monster within and out too ajay atul s precise background score the spellbound scenic value and a world class direction there is so much more this movie has to offer the masala movie watcher may not able to appreciate the movie as it must be but this movie definitely deserves a sensible class of audience the film begins with beautiful cinematography the story is unique bringing mythology n the moral subject of human greed the story is based on the spooky indian mythology horror folktale of a demon who is loaded with gold but deprived of food one family has been able to revive the demon by building a temple inside an isolated n creepy mansion cos of this the family is ostracised the mansion is huge with big doors n fort like walls n only the old father resides in the mansion the wife mistress do visit the mansion everyday to give the old husband a hand job n while she gives him the hand job she asks him to hurry up to which the oldie replies in a funny way the wife also inquires about a gold coin which is kept near the demon s idol the house of the family is walking distance away from the mansion which is inhabited by the wife n her two kids along with the great great grandmother of the old husband who is being cursed to live forever after the bite of the demon n the old hag needs to be fed regularly while she is asleep or she might resort to cannibalism the house is a striking image on top a hill reminding viewers of isolation in the countryside there are no close by neighbors as the family is on their own after their ostracisation there was something very trance like feel in this movie especially the weather n the locations the constant rain and vivid well filmed local landscapes were the characters themselves it is dark n claustrophobic with palpable atmosphere the cinematographer did a fantastic job in creating a perpetual and palpable sense of tension and fear the director also did a nice job of building a concrete hypnotizing story without ever having to sacrifice pacing the story takes place in a span of thirty years n the details r appropriately handled if u notice the mansion in the beginning n after fifteen years u will see all the details attention has been paid in the local ethnic details the time period costumes n architecture also the moral subject of greed n lust were handled very well the subject

be reminded of memorable movies in the genre this one is genuinely scary tumbbad is a triumph in indian cinema for horror thriller genre the atmosphere background score and cinematography all falling into place perfectly for this eerie film to set the mood it nevers leaves that dreaded and thrilling feeling through out the run of this entire film what an amazing cinematography i would say even hollywood can take inspiration out of this which is making all the same type of horror movies these days with cheap thrills and jumpy scenes with out of the loud soundtrack to scare the story is spellbounding and most importantly fresh it s one of the most important fact of the movie which makes it all the more watchable and intriguing thumbs up to the director actor and the cinematographer do yourself a favor and watch this masterpiece of indian cinema we dont deserve movies like tumbbad there is no khan in this movie no item songs and no big stars do yourself a favor by watching tumbbad this week brilliant direction and breathtaking cinematography breaks my heart to see an empty theater on day contribute to meaningful cinema by watching it in theaters or keep complaining about movies like race tumbbadwinninghearts tumbbadwith this movie indian film making has definitely gained a certain level of maturity i have lost my faith in horror cum thriller zone movies which are produced in india in past all they do is cut copy paste this movie is definitely original they do not use sudden creepy sound effects or the old tricks of moving camera over the shoulder the director completely relies on the story to work and it works the camera lenses are well used to portray the claustrophobic scenes the production value is top notch totally uplifts the movie most of the scene includes rain the greens and a dark environment which works superbly director duo do not try to scare you through formula film making methods they don t even try to do that it s the story and the environment which worked for them most of the scenes are designed in low light conditions but the contrast is high enough to attract your eye s attention towards the character actors have pulled there character successfully specially soham shah who is also the producer a thousand year old myth greed deep dark corner of a humen s psyche a monster within and out too ajay atul s precise background score the spellbound scenic value and a world class direction there is so much more this movie has to offer the masala movie watcher may not able to appreciate the movie as it must be but this movie definitely deserves a sensible class of audience the film begins with beautiful cinematography the story is unique bringing mythology n the moral subject of human greed the story is based on the spooky indian mythology horror folktale of a demon who is loaded with gold but deprived of food one family has been able to revive the demon by building a temple inside an isolated n creepy mansion cos of this the family is ostracised the mansion is huge with big doors n fort like walls n only the old father resides in the mansion the wife mistress do visit the mansion everyday to give the old husband a hand job n while she gives him the hand job she asks him to hurry up to which the oldie replies in a funny way the wife also inquires about a gold coin which is kept near the demon s idol the house of the family is walking distance away from the mansion which is inhabited by the wife n her two kids along with the great great grandmother of the old husband who is being cursed to live forever after the bite of the demon n the old hag needs to be fed regularly while she is asleep or she might resort to cannibalism the house is a striking image on top a hill reminding viewers of isolation in the countryside there are no close by neighbors as the family is on their own after their ostracisation there was something very trance like feel in this movie especially the weather n the locations the constant rain and vivid well filmed local landscapes were the characters themselves it is dark n claustrophobic with palpable atmosphere the cinematographer did a fantastic job in creating a perpetual and palpable sense of tension and fear the director also did a nice job of building a concrete hypnotizing story without ever having to sacrifice pacing the story takes place in a span of thirty years n the details r appropriately handled if u notice the mansion in the beginning n after fifteen years u will see all the details attention has been paid in the local ethnic details the time period costumes n architecture also the moral subject of greed n lust were handled very well the subject of sati n female subjugation were sprinkled but not explored soham shah was good n the kids were good too appreciate soham n the producers for producing such a good horror film kudos to the director for a fantastic twist ending this movie will definitely be in the conversation of the greatest indian movies ever made years from now people will be referring to this film as an absolute classic and masterpiece in the genre sohum shah take a bow whoever did the vfx and makeup deserves all the awards the story is so original and i felt the eerie atmosphere throughout the movie also today s bollywood movies often try to show as much brightness in every scene the fact that the cinematography of this film is so awesome that it s dark in the rain just immerses you in the plot and the s i heard it took years of hard work thank you for giving the indian audience this amazing film a big step for the future of indian cinema tumbbad is not a common movie it will leave you gripped to your seat making you think what would happen next whole movie is so beautifully shot no wonder it is shot in natural light and the beauty is visible this movie is a feast for your eyes with cinematic excellence is on full display you wouldnt even have time to wander off your mind but watch it with eyes wide open you won t enjoy it on small screen but have to watch in cinema halls mind you this movie took years in making can you believe in the perseverance of the people who clung onto movie for years despite harships i have to write a review for this spectacular movie this i consider as my duty as a true movie fan who watches at least ten movies in theaters every month i would like to congratulate sohum shah for this movie each frame of this movie is like an art piece and the script is so beautiful they used very few words to describe it but those words clear all your doubt and also let you think on the story people who are saying anything against it are morons this in once in a life time movie tumbbad team you are the best i bet you have never seen anything like this before in bollywood don t miss it its a kind of movie you should watch in movie theatre best cinematography best vfx best storytelling this movie is great has eye catched vfx great original story line this kind of cinema should be appriciate by indian audience becuase this kind of movie should be made this is only possible if indian audiences welcome this kind of different intellectual great cinema hatts of to the producer this movie does not do well in box office the biggest reason behind this is the taste of indian cinema that is so poor the movie is very rich in every way must watch movie this was something that may give may give goosebumps to the makers of hollywood movies this is a movie that will add to the indian cinema a tons but unfortunately indian cinema is not prepared for it the viewers are not prepared for it we are still into watching that regular melodrama and item songs i was fantasized for the making of stree and acting and drama that made it but after watching this i can proudly appreciate the concept and depth that this movie offers this shows us what a thriller can be like the biggest attraction of the movie was the story that was very symbolic of the human craving human craving takes you into darkness is the message of the movie sohum shah has played his part powerfully and so has anita date the direction was not orthodox and was original this is the first movie of its type and definitely hollywood can learn from it this is a much an improvement over the hollywood stories like annabelle conjuring a must entertainment for all watch it especially if you are not into watching the regular drama that indian cinema offers like race original stories like tumbbad are rarely heard forget about made into films the film is bold dark atmospheric and unique this is movie is not like the horror movies which uses jump scares rather it cannot be exactly called a horror movie it is combination of folk fantasy adventure horror which results into a cult kudos to the makers for making this brave film this movie is way different than any horror movie ever made in india it is a perfect blend of mythology greet desi atmosphere with exceptional horror the story setup here is that there is an evil god lurking deep below a broken down colonial estate located in the rural village of tumbbad who has spent an eternity protecting an infinite stash of gold from those who succumb to their own greedy desires while it could use a little tightening in terms of its story tumbbad is a haunting and timeless exploration of just how badly greed can corrupt any of us and we see that perfectly embodied in vinayak s journey throughout the film where he makes some pretty horrendous decisions because of his need to posture as a respected figure in his small community watch this movie in theatre warna race aajayenga people who say bollywood mai story nahi hai content nahi hai now here is the answer watch tumbbad in theatre finally its here an indian horror movie with an indian story and an indian soul it has the smell of wet soil it has the dampness of old house covered with moulds there are no castles and occulists performing exorcism on white eyed monstrous girl instead there is a corrupt feudal lord who exploits a widow bribing her with gold coins but when its time to reward her all he says is swarn mudra kamaani padti hai you realise the truth of this statement later in the movie instead of righteous protagonist we have vinayak who is greedy for wealth which he feels belongs to him but then he is told virasat mein mili har cheez par dawa nahi karte he craves for the treasure and fights his fears and finally reaches to it and boy once you see how he earns it you will feel he definitely deserves it now for the acting part sohum shah absolutely nailed the role of vinayak he has very few dialogues but his eyes do the talking from lecherous to vengeful in a flash and now coming to the main hero of the movie the sets it was hypnotic and beyond words the pre independence era has been captured beautifully and to the tee the walls the grey canvas and my favorite part the locks oh they just take you back in time finally in one line go and watch this movie it is an experience you will take back home with you a story that will stay will you to tease you and taunt you a gorgeous looking intriguing morality tale an ancient myth a hideous demon hidden treasure human greed this potent mix is stirred and ground in tumbbad and the result is a highly unusual visually stunning richly atmospheric concoction of genres and themes i hate indian movies they re garbage just terrible i mean seriously all these singing dancing and all the dramatic crying they all look the same to me but this is the only movie which i liked original screenplay absolutely flawless movie by a genius director i still can t believe this is indian movie highly recommended for horror genre fans it s about time we saw some quality cinema bollywood guys please make movies like this get ride of the khan clan and give new talent a chance see the guy who acts in this movie it was such a breath of fresh air a young boy vinayak rao is affected by a personal tragedy his encounter with a wretched old lady who knows of a buried treasure sets him on the path to greed he grows up to explore the local legend of a monster named hastar and his gold medallions the best form of horror is one which plays with your mind the fear of the uncertain and the unknown is what evokes the strongest emotions tumbbad is a perfect example of a film that creates a surreal illusion this psychological horror has its traditional moments of blood and gore but the most promising part of this terrifying fable is that it makes monsters out of ordinary men a greedy human can be a lot more malicious than a cursed supernatural entity ideas like that make tumbbad a real mind bender and the film s top notch production design makes it a movie that truly reinvents the horror genre for

meaningful cinema by watching it in theaters or keep complaining about movies like race tumbbadwinninghearts tumbbadwith this movie indian film making has definitely gained a certain level of maturity i have lost my faith in horror cum thriller zone movies which are produced in india in past all they do is cut copy paste this movie is definitely original they do not use sudden creepy sound effects or the old tricks of moving camera over the shoulder the director completely relies on the story to work and it works the camera lenses are well used to portray the claustrophobic scenes the production value is top notch totally uplifts the movie most of the scene includes rain the greens and a dark environment which works superbly director duo do not try to scare you through formula film making methods they don t even try to do that it s the story and the environment which worked for them most of the scenes are designed in low light conditions but the contrast is high enough to attract your eye s attention towards the character actors have pulled there character successfully specially soham shah who is also the producer a thousand year old myth greed deep dark corner of a humen s psyche a monster within and out too ajay atul s precise background score the spellbound scenic value and a world class direction there is so much more this movie has to offer the masala movie watcher may not able to appreciate the movie as it must be but this movie definitely deserves a sensible class of audience the film begins with beautiful cinematography the story is unique bringing mythology n the moral subject of human greed the story is based on the spooky indian mythology horror folktale of a demon who is loaded with gold but deprived of food one family has been able to revive the demon by building a temple inside an isolated n creepy mansion cos of this the family is ostracised the mansion is huge with big doors n fort like walls n only the old father resides in the mansion the wife mistress do visit the mansion everyday to give the old husband a hand job n while she gives him the hand job she asks him to hurry up to which the oldie replies in a funny way the wife also inquires about a gold coin which is kept near the demon s idol the house of the family is walking distance away from the mansion which is inhabited by the wife n her two kids along with the great great grandmother of the old husband who is being cursed to live forever after the bite of the demon n the old hag needs to be fed regularly while she is asleep or she might resort to cannibalism the house is a striking image on top a hill reminding viewers of isolation in the countryside there are no close by neighbors as the family is on their own after their ostracisation there was something very trance like feel in this movie especially the weather n the locations the constant rain and vivid well filmed local landscapes were the characters themselves it is dark n claustrophobic with palpable atmosphere the cinematographer did a fantastic job in creating a perpetual and palpable sense of tension and fear the director also did a nice job of building a concrete hypnotizing story without ever having to sacrifice pacing the story takes place in a span of thirty years n the details r appropriately handled if u notice the mansion in the beginning n after fifteen years u will see all the details attention has been paid in the local ethnic details the time period costumes n architecture also the moral subject of greed n lust were handled very well the subject of sati n female subjugation were sprinkled but not explored soham shah was good n the kids were good too appreciate soham n the producers for producing such a good horror film kudos to the director for a fantastic twist ending this movie will definitely be in the conversation of the greatest indian movies ever made years from now people will be referring to this film as an absolute classic and masterpiece in the genre sohum shah take a bow whoever did the vfx and makeup deserves all the awards the story is so original and i felt the eerie atmosphere throughout the movie also today s bollywood movies often try to show as much brightness in every scene the fact that the cinematography of this film is so awesome that it s dark in the rain just immerses you in the plot and the s i heard it took years of hard work thank you for giving the indian audience this amazing film a big step for the future of indian cinema tumbbad is not a common movie it will leave you gripped to your seat making you think what would happen next whole movie is so beautifully shot no wonder it is shot in natural light and the beauty is visible this movie is a feast for your eyes with cinematic excellence is on full display you wouldnt even have time to wander off your mind but watch it with eyes wide open you won t enjoy it on small screen but have to watch in cinema halls mind you this movie took years in making can you believe in the perseverance of the people who clung onto movie for years despite harships i have to write a review for this spectacular movie this i consider as my duty as a true movie fan who watches at least ten movies in theaters every month i would like to congratulate sohum shah for this movie each frame of this movie is like an art piece and the script is so beautiful they used very few words to describe it but those words clear all your doubt and also let you think on the story people who are saying anything against it are morons this in once in a life time movie tumbbad team you are the best i bet you have never seen anything like this before in bollywood don t miss it its a kind of movie you should watch in movie theatre best cinematography best vfx best storytelling this movie is great has eye catched vfx great original story line this kind of cinema should be appriciate by indian audience becuase this kind of movie should be made this is only possible if indian audiences welcome this kind of different intellectual great cinema hatts of to the producer this movie does not do well in box office the biggest reason behind this is the taste of indian cinema that is so poor the movie is very rich in every way must watch movie this was something that may give may give goosebumps to the makers of hollywood movies this is a movie that will add to the indian cinema a tons but unfortunately indian cinema is not prepared for it the viewers are not prepared for it we are still into watching that regular melodrama and item songs i was fantasized for the making of stree and acting and drama that made it but after watching this i can proudly appreciate the concept and depth that this movie offers this shows us what a thriller can be like the biggest attraction of the movie was the story that was very symbolic of the human craving human craving takes you into darkness is the message of the movie sohum shah has played his part powerfully and so has anita date the direction was not orthodox and was original this is the first movie of its type and definitely hollywood can learn from it this is a much an improvement over the hollywood stories like annabelle conjuring a must entertainment for all watch it especially if you are not into watching the regular drama that indian cinema offers like race original stories like tumbbad are rarely heard forget about made into films the film is bold dark atmospheric and unique this is movie is not like the horror movies which uses jump scares rather it cannot be exactly called a horror movie it is combination of folk fantasy adventure horror which results into a cult kudos to the makers for making this brave film this movie is way different than any horror movie ever made in india it is a perfect blend of mythology greet desi atmosphere with exceptional horror the story setup here is that there is an evil god lurking deep below a broken down colonial estate located in the rural village of tumbbad who has spent an eternity protecting an infinite stash of gold from those who succumb to their own greedy desires while it could use a little tightening in terms of its story tumbbad is a haunting and timeless exploration of just how badly greed can corrupt any of us and we see that perfectly embodied in vinayak s journey throughout the film where he makes some pretty horrendous decisions because of his need to posture as a respected figure in his small community watch this movie in theatre warna race aajayenga people who say bollywood mai story nahi hai content nahi hai now here is the answer watch tumbbad in theatre finally its here an indian horror movie with an indian story and an indian soul it has the smell of wet soil it has the dampness of old house covered with moulds there are no castles and occulists performing exorcism on white eyed monstrous girl instead there is a corrupt feudal lord who exploits a widow bribing her with gold coins but when its time to reward her all he says is swarn mudra kamaani padti hai you realise the truth of this statement later in the movie instead of righteous protagonist we have vinayak who is greedy for wealth which he feels belongs to him but then he is told virasat mein mili har cheez par dawa nahi karte he craves for the treasure and fights his fears and finally reaches to it and boy once you see how he earns it you will feel he definitely deserves it now for the acting part sohum shah absolutely nailed the role of vinayak he has very few dialogues but his eyes do the talking from lecherous to vengeful in a flash and now coming to the main hero of the movie the sets it was hypnotic and beyond words the pre independence era has been captured beautifully and to the tee the walls the grey canvas and my favorite part the locks oh they just take you back in time finally in one line go and watch this movie it is an experience you will take back home with you a story that will stay will you to tease you and taunt you a gorgeous looking intriguing morality tale an ancient myth a hideous demon hidden treasure human greed this potent mix is stirred and ground in tumbbad and the result is a highly unusual visually stunning richly atmospheric concoction of genres and themes i hate indian movies they re garbage just terrible i mean seriously all these singing dancing and all the dramatic crying they all look the same to me but this is the only movie which i liked original screenplay absolutely flawless movie by a genius director i still can t believe this is indian movie highly recommended for horror genre fans it s about time we saw some quality cinema bollywood guys please make movies like this get ride of the khan clan and give new talent a chance see the guy who acts in this movie it was such a breath of fresh air a young boy vinayak rao is affected by a personal tragedy his encounter with a wretched old lady who knows of a buried treasure sets him on the path to greed he grows up to explore the local legend of a monster named hastar and his gold medallions the best form of horror is one which plays with your mind the fear of the uncertain and the unknown is what evokes the strongest emotions tumbbad is a perfect example of a film that creates a surreal illusion this psychological horror has its traditional moments of blood and gore but the most promising part of this terrifying fable is that it makes monsters out of ordinary men a greedy human can be a lot more malicious than a cursed supernatural entity ideas like that make tumbbad a real mind bender and the film s top notch production design makes it a movie that truly reinvents the horror genre for indian cinema the film kicks off with a cgi sequence of gods and goddesses and a strong allegory of the destructive nature of greed tumbbad an actual village in maharashtra becomes the fabric of this tale tumbbad is a moody and atmospheric film some viewers may find the film a little too deep and disturbing but fans of hollywood horror films will be reminded of memorable movies in the genre this one is genuinely scary tumbbad is a triumph in indian cinema for horror thriller genre the atmosphere background score and cinematography all falling into place perfectly for this eerie film to set the mood it nevers leaves that dreaded and thrilling feeling through out the run of this entire film what an amazing cinematography i would say even hollywood can take inspiration out of this which is making all the same type of horror movies these days with cheap thrills and jumpy scenes with out of the loud soundtrack to scare the story is spellbounding and most importantly fresh it s one of the most important fact of the movie which makes it all the more watchable

after very long time i ve seen such a beautiful movie tumbaad is a highly engrossing movie and a visual treat original story amidst a backdrop of folklore makes tumbbad a delight though watched it at its initial screening at the venice festival but writing this review after re watch again story about greed that start from an ancient treasure hidden in a mansion the process of reaching to that wealth and the desire to grab more of it and in the process going to any extent i ll sum this movie in these couple of lines not giving the entire story and the plot it has some excellent background score and gripping screenplay does have some minor flaws that can be ignored overall original story and folklore make it a worthy watch with a superlative effort from the actor and producer soham shah enjoy almost two hours of adventure with a seasoning of horror and you will not be disappointed did read some weird reviews from critics mentioning it as an art film not for everybody and some even mentioning it has a lot of marathi influence and hindi speaking audience might not like it very sad indeed my request please do watch it we dont deserve movies like tumbbad there is no khan in this

real mind bender and the film s top notch production design makes it a movie that truly reinvents the horror genre for indian cinema the film kicks off with a cgi sequence of gods and goddesses and a strong allegory of the destructive nature of greed tumbbad an actual village in maharashtra becomes the fabric of this tale tumbbad is a moody and atmospheric film some viewers may find the film a little too deep and disturbing but fans of hollywood horror films will be reminded of memorable movies in the genre this one is genuinely scary tumbbad is a triumph in indian cinema for horror thriller genre the atmosphere background score and cinematography all falling into place perfectly for this eerie film to set the mood it nevers leaves that dreaded and thrilling feeling through out the run of this entire film what an amazing cinematography i would say even hollywood can take inspiration out of this which is making all the same type of horror movies these days with cheap thrills and jumpy scenes with out of the loud soundtrack to scare the story is spellbounding and most importantly fresh it s one of the most important fact of the movie which makes it all the more watchable and intriguing thumbs up to the director actor and the cinematographer do yourself a favor and watch this masterpiece of indian cinema must watch i just came watching movie and it s too good i m still living in tumbbad even after moving out of theatre extremely horror eerie and malicious spooky ride wont let you sleep at night takes indian horror to next level you can see the hard work of cast in movie all sets looks real you can see how star cast removes quality in trailer this movie will remain in your head whole day after watching this movie was awesome after very long time i ve seen such a beautiful movie tumbaad is a highly engrossing movie and a visual treat original story amidst a backdrop of folklore makes tumbbad a delight though watched it at its initial screening at the venice festival but writing this review after re watch again story about greed that start from an ancient treasure hidden in a mansion the process of reaching to that wealth and the desire to grab more of it and in the process going to any extent i ll sum this movie in these couple of lines not giving the entire story and the plot it has some excellent background score and gripping screenplay does have some minor flaws that can be ignored overall original story and folklore make it a worthy watch with a superlative effort from the actor and producer soham shah enjoy almost two hours of adventure with a seasoning of horror and you will not be disappointed did read some weird reviews from critics mentioning it as an art film not for everybody and some even mentioning it has a lot of marathi influence and hindi speaking audience might not like it very sad indeed my request please do watch it wow so many reviews all i can say is part is must was not enough dil maange more we dont deserve movies like tumbbad there is no khan in this movie no item songs and no big stars do yourself a favor by watching tumbbad this week brilliant direction and breathtaking cinematography breaks my heart to see an empty theater on day contribute to meaningful cinema by watching it in theaters or keep complaining about movies like race tumbbadwinninghearts tumbbadwith this movie indian film making has definitely gained a certain level of maturity i have lost my faith in horror cum thriller zone movies which are produced in india in past all they do is cut copy paste this movie is definitely original they do not use sudden creepy sound effects or the old tricks of moving camera over the shoulder the director completely relies on the story to work and it works the camera lenses are well used to portray the claustrophobic scenes the production value is top notch totally uplifts the movie most of the scene includes rain the greens and a dark environment which works superbly director duo do not try to scare you through formula film making methods they don t even try to do that it s the story and the environment which worked for them most of the scenes are designed in low light conditions but the contrast is high enough to attract your eye s attention towards the character actors have pulled there character successfully specially soham shah who is also the producer a thousand year old myth greed deep dark corner of a humen s psyche a monster within and out too ajay atul s precise background score the spellbound scenic value and a world class direction there is so much more this movie has to offer the masala movie watcher may not able to appreciate the movie as it must be but this movie definitely deserves a sensible class of audience the film begins with beautiful cinematography the story is unique bringing mythology n the moral subject of human greed the story is based on the spooky indian mythology horror folktale of a demon who is loaded with gold but deprived of food one family has been able to revive the demon by building a temple inside an isolated n creepy mansion cos of this the family is ostracised the mansion is huge with big doors n fort like walls n only the old father resides in the mansion the wife mistress do visit the mansion everyday to give the old husband a hand job n while she gives him the hand job she asks him to hurry up to which the oldie replies in a funny way the wife also inquires about a gold coin which is kept near the demon s idol the house of the family is walking distance away from the mansion which is inhabited by the wife n her two kids along with the great great grandmother of the old husband who is being cursed to live forever after the bite of the demon n the old hag needs to be fed regularly while she is asleep or she might resort to cannibalism the house is a striking image on top a hill reminding viewers of isolation in the countryside there are no close by neighbors as the family is on their own after their ostracisation there was something very trance like feel in this movie especially the weather n the locations the constant rain and vivid well filmed local landscapes were the characters themselves it is dark n claustrophobic with palpable atmosphere the cinematographer did a fantastic job in creating a perpetual and palpable sense of tension and fear the director also did a nice job of building a concrete hypnotizing story without ever having to sacrifice pacing the story takes place in a span of thirty years n the details r appropriately handled if u notice the mansion in the beginning n after fifteen years u will see all the details attention has been paid in the local ethnic details the time period costumes n architecture also the moral subject of greed n lust were handled very well the subject of sati n female subjugation were sprinkled but not explored soham shah was good n the kids were good too appreciate soham n the producers for producing such a good horror film kudos to the director for a fantastic twist ending this movie will definitely be in the conversation of the greatest indian movies ever made years from now people will be referring to this film as an absolute classic and masterpiece in the genre sohum shah take a bow whoever did the vfx and makeup deserves all the awards the story is so original and i felt the eerie atmosphere throughout the movie also today s bollywood movies often try to show as much brightness in every scene the fact that the cinematography of this film is so awesome that it s dark in the rain just immerses you in the plot and the s i heard it took years of hard work thank you for giving the indian audience this amazing film a big step for the future of indian cinema tumbbad is not a common movie it will leave you gripped to your seat making you think what would happen next whole movie is so beautifully shot no wonder it is shot in natural light and the beauty is visible this movie is a feast for your eyes with cinematic excellence is on full display you wouldnt even have time to wander off your mind but watch it with eyes wide open you won t enjoy it on small screen but have to watch in cinema halls mind you this movie took years in making can you believe in the perseverance of the people who clung onto movie for years despite harships i have to write a review for this spectacular movie this i consider as my duty as a true movie fan who watches at least ten movies in theaters every month i would like to congratulate sohum shah for this movie each frame of this movie is like an art piece and the script is so beautiful they used very few words to describe it but those words clear all your doubt and also let you think on the story people who are saying anything against it are morons this in once in a life time movie tumbbad team you are the best i bet you have never seen anything like this before in bollywood don t miss it its a kind of movie you should watch in movie theatre best cinematography best vfx best storytelling this movie is great has eye catched vfx great original story line this kind of cinema should be appriciate by indian audience becuase this kind of movie should be made this is only possible if indian audiences welcome this kind of different intellectual great cinema hatts of to the producer this movie does not do well in box office the biggest reason behind this is the taste of indian cinema that is so poor the movie is very rich in every way must watch movie this was something that may give may give goosebumps to the makers of hollywood movies this is a movie that will add to the indian cinema a tons but unfortunately indian cinema is not prepared for it the viewers are not prepared for it we are still into watching that regular melodrama and item songs i was fantasized for the making of stree and acting and drama that made it but after watching this i can proudly appreciate the concept and depth that this movie offers this shows us what a thriller can be like the biggest attraction of the movie was the story that was very symbolic of the human craving human craving takes you into darkness is the message of the movie sohum shah has played his part powerfully and so has anita date the direction was not orthodox and was original this is the first movie of its type and definitely hollywood can learn from it this is a much an improvement over the hollywood stories like annabelle conjuring a must entertainment for all watch it especially if you are not into watching the regular drama that indian cinema offers like race original stories like tumbbad are rarely heard forget about made into films the film is bold dark atmospheric and unique this is movie is not like the horror movies which uses jump scares rather it cannot be exactly called a horror movie it is combination of folk fantasy adventure horror which results into a cult kudos to the makers for making this brave film this movie is way different than any horror movie ever made in india it is a perfect blend of mythology greet desi atmosphere with exceptional horror the story setup here is that there is an evil god lurking deep below a broken down colonial estate located in the rural village of tumbbad who has spent an eternity protecting an infinite stash of gold from those who succumb to their own greedy desires while it could use a little tightening in terms of its story tumbbad is a haunting and timeless exploration of just how badly greed can corrupt any of us and we see that perfectly embodied in vinayak s journey throughout the film where he makes some pretty horrendous decisions because of his need to posture as a respected figure in his small community watch this movie in theatre warna race aajayenga people who say bollywood mai story nahi hai content nahi hai now here is the answer watch tumbbad in theatre finally its here an indian horror movie with an indian story and an indian soul it has the smell of wet soil it has the dampness of old house covered with moulds there are no castles and occulists performing exorcism on white eyed monstrous girl instead there is a corrupt feudal lord who exploits a widow bribing her with gold coins but when its time to reward her all he says is swarn mudra kamaani padti hai you realise the truth of this statement later in the movie instead of righteous protagonist we have vinayak who is greedy for wealth which he feels belongs to him but then he is told virasat mein mili har cheez par dawa nahi karte he craves for the treasure and fights his fears and finally reaches to it and boy once you see how he earns it you will feel he definitely deserves it now for the acting part sohum shah absolutely nailed the role of vinayak he has very few dialogues but his eyes do the talking from lecherous to vengeful in a flash and now coming to the main hero of the movie the sets it was hypnotic and beyond words the pre independence era has been captured beautifully and to the tee the walls the grey canvas and my favorite part the locks oh they just take you back in time finally in one line go and watch this movie it is an experience you will take back home with you a story that will stay will you to tease you and taunt you a gorgeous looking intriguing morality tale an ancient myth a hideous demon hidden treasure human greed this potent mix is stirred and ground in tumbbad and the result is a highly unusual visually stunning richly atmospheric concoction of genres and themes i hate indian movies they re garbage just terrible i mean seriously all these singing dancing and all the dramatic crying they all look the same to me but this is the only movie which i liked original screenplay absolutely flawless movie by a genius director i still can t believe this is indian movie highly recommended for horror genre fans it s about time we saw some quality cinema bollywood guys please make movies like this get ride of the khan clan and give new talent a chance see the guy who acts in this movie it was such a breath of fresh air a young boy vinayak rao is affected by a personal tragedy his encounter with a wretched old lady who knows of a buried treasure sets him on the path to greed he grows up to explore the local legend of a monster named hastar and his gold medallions the best form of horror is one which plays with your mind the fear of the uncertain and the unknown is what evokes the strongest emotions tumbbad is a perfect example of a film that creates a surreal illusion this psychological horror has its traditional moments of blood and gore but the most promising part of this terrifying fable is that it makes monsters out of ordinary men a greedy human can be a lot more malicious than a cursed supernatural

Tumbbad team you are the best. I bet you have never seen anything like this before in bollywood. Don\\'t miss it, its a kind of movie you should watch in movie theatre. Best cinematography best vfx best storytelling. This movie is great,has eye catched VFX, Great & Original Story line ..\\nThis kind of cinema should be appriciate by indian audience becuase this kind of movie should be made..& this is only possible if Indian Audiences welcome this kind of different & intellectual & Great cinema ..Hatts of to the Producer.. This movie does not do well in box office & the biggest reason behind this is the Taste of Indian cinema that is so poor & the Movie is very rich in every way.....must watch movie.. We dont deserve movies like Tumbbad. There is no khan in this movie, no item songs, and no big stars. Do yourself a favor by watching #Tumbbad this week. Brilliant direction and breathtaking cinematography. Breaks my heart to see an empty theater on day 2. Contribute to meaningful cinema by watching it in theaters or keep complaining about movies like race3.#TumbbadWinningHearts TumbbadWith this movie , indian film making has definitely gained a certain level of maturity . I have lost my faith in horror cum thriller zone movies which are produced in india, in past all they do is cut copy paste. This movie is definitely original. They do not use sudden creepy sound effects or the old tricks of moving camera over the shoulder. The director completely relies on the story to work and it works. The camera lenses are well used to portray the claustrophobic scenes . The production value is top notch , totally uplifts the movie. Most of the scene includes rain , the greens and a dark environment which works superbly . Director duo do not try to scare you through formula film making methods. They don\\'t even try to do that ,it\\'s the story and the environment which worked for them. Most of the scenes are designed in low light conditions but the contrast is high enough to attract your eye\\'s attention towards the character. Actors have pulled there character successfully specially Soham Shah who is also the producer.\\n A thousand year old myth , greed, deep dark corner of a humen\\'s psyche , a monster (within and out too), ajay atul\\'s precise background score , the spellbound scenic value and a world class direction . There is so much more this movie has to offer. The masala movie watcher may not able to appreciate the movie as it must be but this movie definitely deserves a sensible class of audience. The film begins with beautiful cinematography.\\nThe story is unique, bringing mythology n the moral subject of human greed.\\nThe story is based on the spooky Indian mythology/horror folktale of a demon who is loaded with gold but deprived of food.\\nOne family has been able to revive the demon by building a temple inside an isolated n creepy mansion. Cos of this the family is ostracised.\\nThe mansion is huge with big doors n fort like walls n only the old father resides in the mansion. The wife/mistress do visit the mansion everyday to give the old husband a hand-job n while she gives him the hand-job, she asks him to hurry up, to which the oldie replies in a funny way. The wife also inquires about a gold coin which is kept near the demon\\'s idol.\\nThe house of the family is walking distance away from the mansion which is inhabited by the wife n her two kids along with the great great grandmother of the old husband who is being cursed to live forever after the bite of the demon n the old hag needs to be fed regularly while she is asleep or she might resort to cannibalism.\\nThe house is a striking image on top a hill, reminding viewers of isolation in the countryside.\\nThere are no close-by neighbors, as the family is on their own after their ostracisation.\\nThere was something very trance like feel in this movie, especially the weather n the locations.\\nThe constant rain and vivid, well filmed local landscapes were the characters themselves.\\nIt is dark n claustrophobic with palpable atmosphere.\\nThe cinematographer did a fantastic job in creating a perpetual and palpable sense of tension and fear.\\nThe director also did a nice job of building a concrete, hypnotizing story without ever having to sacrifice pacing.\\nThe story takes place in a span of thirty years n the details r appropriately handled.\\nIf u notice the mansion in the beginning n after fifteen years, u will see all the details.\\nAttention has been paid in the local ethnic details, the time period, costumes n architecture.\\nAlso the moral subject of greed n lust were handled very well. The subject of Sati n female subjugation were sprinkled but not explored.\\nSoham Shah was good n the kids were good too.\\nAppreciate Soham n the producers for producing such a good horror film.\\nKudos to the director for a fantastic twist ending. This movie will definitely be in the conversation of the greatest Indian movies ever made. 50 years from now, people will be referring to this film as an absolute classic and masterpiece in the genre. Sohum Shah, take a bow. Whoever did the VFX and Makeup deserves all the awards. The story is so original and I felt the eerie atmosphere throughout the movie. Also, today\\'s bollywood movies often try to show as much brightness in every scene. The fact that the cinematography of this film is so awesome, that it\\'s dark, in the rain, just immerses you in the plot and the 1900s. I heard it took 6 years of hard work. Thank you for giving the Indian audience this amazing film. A big step for the future of Indian cinema Tumbbad is not a common movie. It will leave you gripped to your seat making you think \"what would happen next\". Whole movie is so beautifully shot no wonder it is shot in natural light and the beauty is visible. This movie is a feast for your eyes with cinematic excellence is on full display. You wouldnt even have time to wander off your mind but watch it with eyes wide open. You won\\'t enjoy it on small screen but have to watch in cinema halls. Mind you this movie took 6 years in making can you believe in the perseverance of the people who clung onto movie for 6 years despite harships. I have to write a review for this spectacular movie, this i consider as my duty as a true movie fan who watches at least ten movies in theaters every month.

This movie will definitely be in the conversation of the greatest Indian movies ever made. 50 years from now, people will be referring to this film as an absolute classic and masterpiece in the genre. Sohum Shah, take a bow. Whoever did the VFX and Makeup deserves all the awards. The story is so original and I felt the eerie atmosphere throughout the movie. Also, today\\'s bollywood movies often try to show as much brightness in every scene. The fact that the cinematography of this film is so awesome, that it\\'s dark, in the rain, just immerses you in the plot and the 1900s. I heard it took 6 years of hard work. Thank you for giving the Indian audience this amazing film. A big step for the future of Indian cinema Tumbbad is not a common movie. It will leave you gripped to your seat making you think \"what would happen next\". Whole movie is so beautifully shot no wonder it is shot in natural light and the beauty is visible. This movie is a feast for your eyes with cinematic excellence is on full display. You wouldnt even have time to wander off your mind but watch it with eyes wide open. You won\\'t enjoy it on small screen but have to watch in cinema halls. Mind you this movie took 6 years in making can you believe in the perseverance of the people who clung onto movie for 6 years despite harships. I have to write a review for this spectacular movie, this i consider as my duty as a true movie fan who watches at least ten movies in theaters every month. I would like to congratulate sohum shah for this movie. Each frame of this movie is like an art piece, and the script is so beautiful, they used very few words to describe it. but those words clear all your doubt and also let you think on the story, people who are saying anything against it are morons, this in once in a life time movie. Tumbbad team you are the best. I bet you have never seen anything like this before in bollywood. Don\\'t miss it, its a kind of movie you should watch in movie theatre. Best cinematography best vfx best storytelling. This movie is great,has eye catched VFX, Great & Original Story line ..\\nThis kind of cinema should be appriciate by indian audience becuase this kind of movie should be made..& this is only possible if Indian Audiences welcome this kind of different & intellectual & Great cinema ..Hatts of to the Producer.. This movie does not do well in box office & the biggest reason behind this is the Taste of Indian cinema that is so poor & the Movie is very rich in every way.....must watch movie.. This was something that may give may give \\'goosebumps\\' to the makers of Hollywood movies. This is a movie that will add to the Indian cinema a tons but unfortunately Indian cinema is not prepared for it. The viewers are not prepared for it. We are still into watching that regular melodrama and item songs.\\nI was fantasized for the making of Stree and acting and drama that made it. But after watching this I can proudly appreciate the concept and depth that this movie offers. This shows us what a thriller can be like. The biggest attraction of the movie was the story that was very symbolic of the human craving. Human craving takes you into darkness is the message of the movie .\\nSohum Shah has played his part powerfully and so has Anita Date.\\nThe direction was not orthodox and was original.\\nThis is the first movie of its type and definitely Hollywood can learn from it. This is a much an improvement over the Hollywood stories like Annabelle, Conjuring.\\nA must entertainment for all. Watch it, especially if you are not into watching the regular drama that Indian cinema offers like Race 3 Original stories like Tumbbad are rarely heard forget about made into films. The film is bold,dark,atmospheric and unique. This is movie is not like the horror movies which uses jump scares. Rather it cannot be exactly called a horror movie. It is combination of folk,fantasy, adventure,horror which results into a cult. Kudos to the makers for making this brave film!! This movie is way different than any horror movie ever made in india...it is a perfect blend of mythology, greet, desi atmosphere with exceptional horror.\\nThe story setup here is that there is an evil god lurking deep below a broken-down colonial estate located in the rural village of Tumbbad, who has spent an eternity protecting an infinite stash of gold from those who succumb to their own greedy desires.While it could use a little tightening in terms of its story, Tumbbad is a haunting and timeless exploration of just how badly greed can corrupt any of us, and we see that perfectly embodied in Vinayak\\'s journey throughout the film, where he makes some pretty horrendous decisions because of his need to posture as a respected figure in his small community. Watch this movie in Theatre warna Race 4 aajayenga.\\nPeople who say Bollywood Mai story Nahi hai content nahi hai now here is the answer\\nWatch Tumbbad in Theatre Finally its here!!! An Indian horror movie with an Indian story and an Indian soul. It has the smell of wet soil..it has the dampness of old house covered with moulds. There are no castles and occulists performing exorcism on white eyed monstrous girl.\\nInstead there is a corrupt feudal lord who exploits a widow, bribing her with gold coins. But when its time to reward her, all he says is\"swarn mudra kamaani padti hai.\" You realise the truth of this statement later in the movie.\\nInstead of righteous protagonist, we have Vinayak who is greedy for wealth which he feels belongs to him. But then he is told, \"Virasat mein mili har cheez par dawa nahi karte.\" He craves for the treasure and fights his fears and finally reaches to it. And boy!!! Once you see how he earns it..you will feel he definitely deserves it. \\nNow for the acting part...Sohum Shah absolutely nailed the role of Vinayak. He has very few dialogues but his eyes do the talking. From lecherous to vengeful in a flash.\\nAnd now coming to the main hero of the movie...the sets!!! It was hypnotic and beyond words!! The pre independence era has been captured beautifully and to the tee. The walls..the grey canvas...and my favorite part..the locks!! Oh..they just take you back in time.\\nFinally..in one line...Go and watch this movie.It is an experience you will take back home with you. A story that will stay will you to tease you and taunt you. We dont deserve movies like Tumbbad. There is no khan in this movie, no item songs, and no big stars. Do yourself a favor by watching #Tumbbad this week. Brilliant direction and breathtaking cinematography. Breaks my heart to see an empty theater on day 2. Contribute to meaningful cinema by watching it in theaters or keep complaining about movies like race3.#TumbbadWinningHearts TumbbadWith this movie , indian film making has definitely gained a certain level of maturity . I have lost my faith in horror cum thriller zone movies which are produced in india, in past all they do is cut copy paste. This movie is definitely original.

You won\\'t enjoy it on small screen but have to watch in cinema halls. Mind you this movie took 6 years in making can you believe in the perseverance of the people who clung onto movie for 6 years despite harships. I have to write a review for this spectacular movie, this i consider as my duty as a true movie fan who watches at least ten movies in theaters every month. I would like to congratulate sohum shah for this movie. Each frame of this movie is like an art piece, and the script is so beautiful, they used very few words to describe it. but those words clear all your doubt and also let you think on the story, people who are saying anything against it are morons, this in once in a life time movie. Tumbbad team you are the best. I bet you have never seen anything like this before in bollywood. Don\\'t miss it, its a kind of movie you should watch in movie theatre. Best cinematography best vfx best storytelling. This movie is great,has eye catched VFX, Great & Original Story line ..\\nThis kind of cinema should be appriciate by indian audience becuase this kind of movie should be made..& this is only possible if Indian Audiences welcome this kind of different & intellectual & Great cinema ..Hatts of to the Producer.. This movie does not do well in box office & the biggest reason behind this is the Taste of Indian cinema that is so poor & the Movie is very rich in every way.....must watch movie.. This was something that may give may give \\'goosebumps\\' to the makers of Hollywood movies. This is a movie that will add to the Indian cinema a tons but unfortunately Indian cinema is not prepared for it. The viewers are not prepared for it. We are still into watching that regular melodrama and item songs.\\nI was fantasized for the making of Stree and acting and drama that made it. But after watching this I can proudly appreciate the concept and depth that this movie offers. This shows us what a thriller can be like. The biggest attraction of the movie was the story that was very symbolic of the human craving. Human craving takes you into darkness is the message of the movie .\\nSohum Shah has played his part powerfully and so has Anita Date.\\nThe direction was not orthodox and was original.\\nThis is the first movie of its type and definitely Hollywood can learn from it. This is a much an improvement over the Hollywood stories like Annabelle, Conjuring.\\nA must entertainment for all. Watch it, especially if you are not into watching the regular drama that Indian cinema offers like Race 3 Original stories like Tumbbad are rarely heard forget about made into films. The film is bold,dark,atmospheric and unique. This is movie is not like the horror movies which uses jump scares. Rather it cannot be exactly called a horror movie. It is combination of folk,fantasy, adventure,horror which results into a cult. Kudos to the makers for making this brave film!! This movie is way different than any horror movie ever made in india...it is a perfect blend of mythology, greet, desi atmosphere with exceptional horror.\\nThe story setup here is that there is an evil god lurking deep below a broken-down colonial estate located in the rural village of Tumbbad, who has spent an eternity protecting an infinite stash of gold from those who succumb to their own greedy desires.While it could use a little tightening in terms of its story, Tumbbad is a haunting and timeless exploration of just how badly greed can corrupt any of us, and we see that perfectly embodied in Vinayak\\'s journey throughout the film, where he makes some pretty horrendous decisions because of his need to posture as a respected figure in his small community. Watch this movie in Theatre warna Race 4 aajayenga.\\nPeople who say Bollywood Mai story Nahi hai content nahi hai now here is the answer\\nWatch Tumbbad in Theatre Finally its here!!! An Indian horror movie with an Indian story and an Indian soul. It has the smell of wet soil..it has the dampness of old house covered with moulds. There are no castles and occulists performing exorcism on white eyed monstrous girl.\\nInstead there is a corrupt feudal lord who exploits a widow, bribing her with gold coins. But when its time to reward her, all he says is\"swarn mudra kamaani padti hai.\" You realise the truth of this statement later in the movie.\\nInstead of righteous protagonist, we have Vinayak who is greedy for wealth which he feels belongs to him. But then he is told, \"Virasat mein mili har cheez par dawa nahi karte.\" He craves for the treasure and fights his fears and finally reaches to it. And boy!!! Once you see how he earns it..you will feel he definitely deserves it. \\nNow for the acting part...Sohum Shah absolutely nailed the role of Vinayak. He has very few dialogues but his eyes do the talking. From lecherous to vengeful in a flash.\\nAnd now coming to the main hero of the movie...the sets!!! It was hypnotic and beyond words!! The pre independence era has been captured beautifully and to the tee. The walls..the grey canvas...and my favorite part..the locks!! Oh..they just take you back in time.\\nFinally..in one line...Go and watch this movie.It is an experience you will take back home with you. A story that will stay will you to tease you and taunt you. A gorgeous looking, intriguing morality tale..\\nAn ancient myth. A hideous demon. Hidden treasure. Human greed. This potent mix is stirred and ground in Tumbbad, and the result is a highly unusual, visually stunning, richly atmospheric concoction of genres and themes I hate indian movies they\\'re garbage just terrible I mean seriously all these singing, dancing and all the dramatic crying they all look the same to me\\nBUT this is the only movie which I liked original screenplay absolutely flawless movie by a genius director I still can\\'t believe this is indian movie highly recommended for horror genre fans It\\'s about time we saw some quality cinema, Bollywood guys please make movies like this. Get ride of the Khan clan and give new talent a chance. See the guy who acts in this movie. It was such a breath of fresh air. We dont deserve movies like Tumbbad. There is no khan in this movie, no item songs, and no big stars. Do yourself a favor by watching #Tumbbad this week. Brilliant direction and breathtaking cinematography. Breaks my heart to see an empty theater on day 2. Contribute to meaningful cinema by watching it in theaters or keep complaining about movies like race3.#TumbbadWinningHearts TumbbadWith this movie , indian film making has definitely gained a certain level of maturity . I have lost my faith in horror cum thriller zone movies which are produced in india, in past all they do is cut copy paste. This movie is definitely original. They do not use sudden creepy sound effects or the old tricks of moving camera over the shoulder. The director completely relies on the story to work and it works. The camera lenses are well used to portray the claustrophobic scenes . The production value is top notch , totally uplifts the movie. Most of the scene includes rain , the greens and a dark environment which works superbly . Director duo do not try to scare you through formula film making methods. They don\\'t even try to do that ,it\\'s the story and the environment which worked for them.

Sohum Shah, take a bow. Whoever did the VFX and Makeup deserves all the awards. The story is so original and I felt the eerie atmosphere throughout the movie. Also, today\\'s bollywood movies often try to show as much brightness in every scene. The fact that the cinematography of this film is so awesome, that it\\'s dark, in the rain, just immerses you in the plot and the 1900s. I heard it took 6 years of hard work. Thank you for giving the Indian audience this amazing film. A big step for the future of Indian cinema Tumbbad is not a common movie.

This was something that may give may give \\'goosebumps\\' to the makers of Hollywood movies. This is a movie that will add to the Indian cinema a tons but unfortunately Indian cinema is not prepared for it. The viewers are not prepared for it. We are still into watching that regular melodrama and item songs.\\nI was fantasized for the making of Stree and acting and drama that made it. But after watching this I can proudly appreciate the concept and depth that this movie offers. This shows us what a thriller can be like. The biggest attraction of the movie was the story that was very symbolic of the human craving. Human craving takes you into darkness is the message of the movie .\\nSohum Shah has played his part powerfully and so has Anita Date.\\nThe direction was not orthodox and was original.\\nThis is the first movie of its type and definitely Hollywood can learn from it. This is a much an improvement over the Hollywood stories like Annabelle, Conjuring.\\nA must entertainment for all. Watch it, especially if you are not into watching the regular drama that Indian cinema offers like Race 3 Original stories like Tumbbad are rarely heard forget about made into films. The film is bold,dark,atmospheric and unique. This is movie is not like the horror movies which uses jump scares. Rather it cannot be exactly called a horror movie. It is combination of folk,fantasy, adventure,horror which results into a cult. Kudos to the makers for making this brave film!! This movie is way different than any horror movie ever made in india...it is a perfect blend of mythology, greet, desi atmosphere with exceptional horror.\\nThe story setup here is that there is an evil god lurking deep below a broken-down colonial estate located in the rural village of Tumbbad, who has spent an eternity protecting an infinite stash of gold from those who succumb to their own greedy desires.While it could use a little tightening in terms of its story, Tumbbad is a haunting and timeless exploration of just how badly greed can corrupt any of us, and we see that perfectly embodied in Vinayak\\'s journey throughout the film, where he makes some pretty horrendous decisions because of his need to posture as a respected figure in his small community. Watch this movie in Theatre warna Race 4 aajayenga.\\nPeople who say Bollywood Mai story Nahi hai content nahi hai now here is the answer\\nWatch Tumbbad in Theatre Finally its here!!! An Indian horror movie with an Indian story and an Indian soul. It has the smell of wet soil..it has the dampness of old house covered with moulds.

But when its time to reward her, all he says is\"swarn mudra kamaani padti hai.\" You realise the truth of this statement later in the movie.\\nInstead of righteous protagonist, we have Vinayak who is greedy for wealth which he feels belongs to him. But then he is told, \"Virasat mein mili har cheez par dawa nahi karte.\" He craves for the treasure and fights his fears and finally reaches to it. And boy!!! Once you see how he earns it..you will feel he definitely deserves it. \\nNow for the acting part...Sohum Shah absolutely nailed the role of Vinayak. He has very few dialogues but his eyes do the talking. From lecherous to vengeful in a flash.\\nAnd now coming to the main hero of the movie...the sets!!! It was hypnotic and beyond words!! The pre independence era has been captured beautifully and to the tee. The walls..the grey canvas...and my favorite part..the locks!! Oh..they just take you back in time.\\nFinally..in one line...Go and watch this movie.It is an experience you will take back home with you. A story that will stay will you to tease you and taunt you.

Though watched it at its initial screening at the Venice festival but writing this review after re-watch again.Story about greed that start from an ancient treasure hidden in a mansion. The process of reaching to that wealth and the desire to grab more of it and in the process going to any extent. I\\'ll sum this movie in these couple of lines not giving the entire story and the plot. It has some Excellent background score and gripping screenplay. Does have some minor flaws that can be ignored. Overall, original story and folklore make it a worthy watch with a superlative effort from the actor and producer Soham Shah. Enjoy almost two hours of adventure with a seasoning of Horror and you will not be disappointed. Did read some weird reviews from critics mentioning it \" as an art film\" not for everybody and some even mentioning \" it has a lot of Marathi influence and Hindi speaking audience might not like it \" very sad Indeed.

Mind you this movie took 6 years in making can you believe in the perseverance of the people who clung onto movie for 6 years despite harships. I have to write a review for this spectacular movie, this i consider as my duty as a true movie fan who watches at least ten movies in theaters every month. I would like to congratulate sohum shah for this movie. Each frame of this movie is like an art piece, and the script is so beautiful, they used very few words to describe it. but those words clear all your doubt and also let you think on the story, people who are saying anything against it are morons, this in once in a life time movie. Tumbbad team you are the best. I bet you have never seen anything like this before in bollywood. Don\\'t miss it, its a kind of movie you should watch in movie theatre. Best cinematography best vfx best storytelling. This movie is great,has eye catched VFX, Great & Original Story line ..\\nThis kind of cinema should be appriciate by indian audience becuase this kind of movie should be made..& this is only possible if Indian Audiences welcome this kind of different & intellectual & Great cinema ..Hatts of to the Producer.. This movie does not do well in box office & the biggest reason behind this is the Taste of Indian cinema that is so poor & the Movie is very rich in every way.....must watch movie.. This was something that may give may give \\'goosebumps\\' to the makers of Hollywood movies. This is a movie that will add to the Indian cinema a tons but unfortunately Indian cinema is not prepared for it. The viewers are not prepared for it. We are still into watching that regular melodrama and item songs.\\nI was fantasized for the making of Stree and acting and drama that made it. But after watching this I can proudly appreciate the concept and depth that this movie offers. This shows us what a thriller can be like. The biggest attraction of the movie was the story that was very symbolic of the human craving. Human craving takes you into darkness is the message of the movie .\\nSohum Shah has played his part powerfully and so has Anita Date.\\nThe direction was not orthodox and was original.\\nThis is the first movie of its type and definitely Hollywood can learn from it. This is a much an improvement over the Hollywood stories like Annabelle, Conjuring.\\nA must entertainment for all. Watch it, especially if you are not into watching the regular drama that Indian cinema offers like Race 3 Original stories like Tumbbad are rarely heard forget about made into films. The film is bold,dark,atmospheric and unique. This is movie is not like the horror movies which uses jump scares. Rather it cannot be exactly called a horror movie. It is combination of folk,fantasy, adventure,horror which results into a cult. Kudos to the makers for making this brave film!! This movie is way different than any horror movie ever made in india...it is a perfect blend of mythology, greet, desi atmosphere with exceptional horror.\\nThe story setup here is that there is an evil god lurking deep below a broken-down colonial estate located in the rural village of Tumbbad, who has spent an eternity protecting an infinite stash of gold from those who succumb to their own greedy desires.While it could use a little tightening in terms of its story, Tumbbad is a haunting and timeless exploration of just how badly greed can corrupt any of us, and we see that perfectly embodied in Vinayak\\'s journey throughout the film, where he makes some pretty horrendous decisions because of his need to posture as a respected figure in his small community. Watch this movie in Theatre warna Race 4 aajayenga.\\nPeople who say Bollywood Mai story Nahi hai content nahi hai now here is the answer\\nWatch Tumbbad in Theatre Finally its here!!! An Indian horror movie with an Indian story and an Indian soul. It has the smell of wet soil..it has the dampness of old house covered with moulds. There are no castles and occulists performing exorcism on white eyed monstrous girl.\\nInstead there is a corrupt feudal lord who exploits a widow, bribing her with gold coins. But when its time to reward her, all he says is\"swarn mudra kamaani padti hai.\" You realise the truth of this statement later in the movie.\\nInstead of righteous protagonist, we have Vinayak who is greedy for wealth which he feels belongs to him. But then he is told, \"Virasat mein mili har cheez par dawa nahi karte.\" He craves for the treasure and fights his fears and finally reaches to it. And boy!!! Once you see how he earns it..you will feel he definitely deserves it. \\nNow for the acting part...Sohum Shah absolutely nailed the role of Vinayak. He has very few dialogues but his eyes do the talking. From lecherous to vengeful in a flash.\\nAnd now coming to the main hero of the movie...the sets!!! It was hypnotic and beyond words!! The pre independence era has been captured beautifully and to the tee. The walls..the grey canvas...and my favorite part..the locks!! Oh..they just take you back in time.\\nFinally..in one line...Go and watch this movie.It is an experience you will take back home with you. A story that will stay will you to tease you and taunt you. A gorgeous looking, intriguing morality tale..\\nAn ancient myth. A hideous demon. Hidden treasure. Human greed. This potent mix is stirred and ground in Tumbbad, and the result is a highly unusual, visually stunning, richly atmospheric concoction of genres and themes I hate indian movies they\\'re garbage just terrible I mean seriously all these singing, dancing and all the dramatic crying they all look the same to me\\nBUT this is the only movie which I liked original screenplay absolutely flawless movie by a genius director I still can\\'t believe this is indian movie highly recommended for horror genre fans It\\'s about time we saw some quality cinema, Bollywood guys please make movies like this. Get ride of the Khan clan and give new talent a chance. See the guy who acts in this movie. It was such a breath of fresh air. -----A young boy Vinayak Rao is affected by a personal tragedy. His encounter with a wretched old lady who knows of a buried treasure sets him on the path to greed. He grows up to explore the local legend of a monster named Hastar and his gold medallions. The best form of horror is one which plays with your mind. The fear of the uncertain and the unknown is what evokes the strongest emotions. Tumbbad is a perfect example of a film that creates a surreal illusion. This psychological horror has its traditional moments of blood and gore, but the most promising part of this terrifying fable is that it makes monsters out of ordinary men. A greedy human can be a lot more malicious than a cursed supernatural entity. Ideas like that make Tumbbad a real mind-bender and the film\\'s top-notch production design makes it a movie that truly reinvents the horror genre for Indian cinema.\\nThe film kicks off with a CGI sequence of gods and goddesses and a strong allegory of the destructive nature of greed. Tumbbad, an actual village in Maharashtra, becomes the fabric of this tale. Tumbbad is a moody and atmospheric film. Some viewers may find the film a little too deep and disturbing, but fans of Hollywood horror films will be reminded of memorable movies in the genre. This one is genuinely scary. Tumbbad is a triumph in Indian cinema for horror/thriller genre. The atmosphere, background score and cinematography all falling into place perfectly for this eerie film to set the mood. It nevers leaves that dreaded and thrilling feeling through out the run of this entire film. \\nWhat an amazing cinematography, I would say. Even hollywood can take inspiration out of this which is making all the same type of horror movies these days with cheap thrills and jumpy scenes with out of the loud soundtrack to scare. \\nThe story is spellbounding and most importantly fresh. It\\'s one of the most important fact of the movie which makes it all the more watchable and intriguing.\\nThumbs up to the director, actor and the cinematographer. Do yourself a favor and watch this masterpiece of Indian cinema. Must watch.. I just came watching movie and it\\'s too good. I\\'m still living in Tumbbad even after moving out of theatre.. Extremely horror, eerie and malicious,spooky ride,wont let you sleep at night. Takes Indian horror to next level.\\nyou can see the hard work of cast in movie.\\nall sets looks real.\\nyou can see how star cast removes quality in 2.0 trailer.\\nthis movie will remain in your head whole day after watching. This movie was awesome...after very long time I\\'ve seen such a beautiful movie... TUMBAAD is a highly engrossing movie and a Visual treat. Original Story amidst a backdrop of folklore makes Tumbbad a delight. Though watched it at its initial screening at the Venice festival but writing this review after re-watch again.Story about greed that start from an ancient treasure hidden in a mansion. The process of reaching to that wealth and the desire to grab more of it and in the process going to any extent. I\\'ll sum this movie in these couple of lines not giving the entire story and the plot. It has some Excellent background score and gripping screenplay. Does have some minor flaws that can be ignored. Overall, original story and folklore make it a worthy watch with a superlative effort from the actor and producer Soham Shah. Enjoy almost two hours of adventure with a seasoning of Horror and you will not be disappointed. Did read some weird reviews from critics mentioning it \" as an art film\" not for everybody and some even mentioning \" it has a lot of Marathi influence and Hindi speaking audience might not like it \" very sad Indeed. My request please do watch it. Wow so many reviews!!! All I can say is PART 2 is must..... 1 was not enough... dil maange more! We dont deserve movies like Tumbbad. There is no khan in this movie, no item songs, and no big stars. Do yourself a favor by watching #Tumbbad this week. Brilliant direction and breathtaking cinematography. Breaks my heart to see an empty theater on day 2. Contribute to meaningful cinema by watching it in theaters or keep complaining about movies like race3.#TumbbadWinningHearts TumbbadWith this movie , indian film making has definitely gained a certain level of maturity . I have lost my faith in horror cum thriller zone movies which are produced in india, in past all they do is cut copy paste. This movie is definitely original. They do not use sudden creepy sound effects or the old tricks of moving camera over the shoulder. The director completely relies on the story to work and it works. The camera lenses are well used to portray the claustrophobic scenes . The production value is top notch , totally uplifts the movie. Most of the scene includes rain , the greens and a dark environment which works superbly . Director duo do not try to scare you through formula film making methods. They don\\'t even try to do that ,it\\'s the story and the environment which worked for them. Most of the scenes are designed in low light conditions but the contrast is high enough to attract your eye\\'s attention towards the character. Actors have pulled there character successfully specially Soham Shah who is also the producer.\\n A thousand year old myth , greed, deep dark corner of a humen\\'s psyche , a monster (within and out too), ajay atul\\'s precise background score , the spellbound scenic value and a world class direction . There is so much more this movie has to offer. The masala movie watcher may not able to appreciate the movie as it must be but this movie definitely deserves a sensible class of audience. The film begins with beautiful cinematography.\\nThe story is unique, bringing mythology n the moral subject of human greed.\\nThe story is based on the spooky Indian mythology/horror folktale of a demon who is loaded with gold but deprived of food.\\nOne family has been able to revive the demon by building a temple inside an isolated n creepy mansion. Cos of this the family is ostracised.\\nThe mansion is huge with big doors n fort like walls n only the old father resides in the mansion. The wife/mistress do visit the mansion everyday to give the old husband a hand-job n while she gives him the hand-job, she asks him to hurry up, to which the oldie replies in a funny way. The wife also inquires about a gold coin which is kept near the demon\\'s idol.\\nThe house of the family is walking distance away from the mansion which is inhabited by the wife n her two kids along with the great great grandmother of the old husband who is being cursed to live forever after the bite of the demon n the old hag needs to be fed regularly while she is asleep or she might resort to cannibalism.\\nThe house is a striking image on top a hill, reminding viewers of isolation in the countryside.\\nThere are no close-by neighbors, as the family is on their own after their ostracisation.\\nThere was something very trance like feel in this movie, especially the weather n the locations.\\nThe constant rain and vivid, well filmed local landscapes were the characters themselves.\\nIt is dark n claustrophobic with palpable atmosphere.\\nThe cinematographer did a fantastic job in creating a perpetual and palpable sense of tension and fear.\\nThe director also did a nice job of building a concrete, hypnotizing story without ever having to sacrifice pacing.\\nThe story takes place in a span of thirty years n the details r appropriately handled.\\nIf u notice the mansion in the beginning n after fifteen years, u will see all the details.\\nAttention has been paid in the local ethnic details, the time period, costumes n architecture.\\nAlso the moral subject of greed n lust were handled very well. The subject of Sati n female subjugation were sprinkled but not explored.\\nSoham Shah was good n the kids were good too.\\nAppreciate Soham n the producers for producing such a good horror film.\\nKudos to the director for a fantastic twist ending. This movie will definitely be in the conversation of the greatest Indian movies ever made. 50 years from now, people will be referring to this film as an absolute classic and masterpiece in the genre. Sohum Shah, take a bow. Whoever did the VFX and Makeup deserves all the awards. The story is so original and I felt the eerie atmosphere throughout the movie. Also, today\\'s bollywood movies often try to show as much brightness in every scene. The fact that the cinematography of this film is so awesome, that it\\'s dark, in the rain, just immerses you in the plot and the 1900s. I heard it took 6 years of hard work. Thank you for giving the Indian audience this amazing film. A big step for the future of Indian cinema Tumbbad is not a common movie. It will leave you gripped to your seat making you think \"what would happen next\". Whole movie is so beautifully shot no wonder it is shot in natural light and the beauty is visible. This movie is a feast for your eyes with cinematic excellence is on full display. You wouldnt even have time to wander off your mind but watch it with eyes wide open.

The camera lenses are well used to portray the claustrophobic scenes . The production value is top notch , totally uplifts the movie.

They do not use sudden creepy sound effects or the old tricks of moving camera over the shoulder. The director completely relies on the story to work and it works. The camera lenses are well used to portray the claustrophobic scenes . The production value is top notch , totally uplifts the movie. Most of the scene includes rain , the greens and a dark environment which works superbly . Director duo do not try to scare you through formula film making methods. They don't even try to do that ,it's the story and the environment which worked for them. Most of the scenes are designed in low light conditions but the contrast is high enough to attract your eye's attention towards the character.

He grows up to explore the local legend of a monster named Hastar and his gold medallions. The best form of horror is one which plays with your mind. The fear of the uncertain and the unknown is what evokes the strongest emotions. Tumbbad is a perfect example of a film that creates a surreal illusion. This psychological horror has its traditional moments of blood and gore, but the most promising part of this terrifying fable is that it makes monsters out of ordinary men. A greedy human can be a lot more malicious than a cursed supernatural entity. Ideas like that make Tumbbad a real mind-bender and the film's top-notch production design makes it a movie that truly reinvents the horror genre for Indian cinema.\\nThe film kicks off with a CGI sequence of gods and goddesses and a strong allegory of the destructive nature of greed. Tumbbad, an actual village in Maharashtra, becomes the fabric of this tale. Tumbbad is a moody and atmospheric film. Some viewers may find the film a little too deep and disturbing, but fans of Hollywood horror films will be reminded of memorable movies in the genre. This one is genuinely scary.\"]\n",

The camera lenses are well used to portray the claustrophobic scenes . The production value is top notch , totally uplifts the movie. Most of the scene includes rain , the greens and a dark environment which works superbly . Director duo do not try to scare you through formula film making methods. They don't even try to do that ,it's the story and the environment which worked for them. Most of the scenes are designed in low light conditions but the contrast is high enough to attract your eye's attention towards the character.

      "[b\"-----A young boy Vinayak Rao is affected by a personal tragedy. His encounter with a wretched old lady who knows of a buried treasure sets him on the path to greed. He grows up to explore the local legend of a monster named Hastar and his gold medallions. The best form of horror is one which plays with your mind. The fear of the uncertain and the unknown is what evokes the strongest emotions. Tumbbad is a perfect example of a film that creates a surreal illusion. This psychological horror has its traditional moments of blood and gore, but the most promising part of this terrifying fable is that it makes monsters out of ordinary men. A greedy human can be a lot more malicious than a cursed supernatural entity. Ideas like that make Tumbbad a real mind-bender and the film's top-notch production design makes it a movie that truly reinvents the horror genre for Indian cinema.\\nThe film kicks off with a CGI sequence of gods and goddesses and a strong allegory of the destructive nature of greed. Tumbbad, an actual village in Maharashtra, becomes the fabric of this tale. Tumbbad is a moody and atmospheric film. Some viewers may find the film a little too deep and disturbing, but fans of Hollywood horror films will be reminded of memorable movies in the genre. This one is genuinely scary.\"]\n",

The fear of the uncertain and the unknown is what evokes the strongest emotions. Tumbbad is a perfect example of a film that creates a surreal illusion. This psychological horror has its traditional moments of blood and gore, but the most promising part of this terrifying fable is that it makes monsters out of ordinary men. A greedy human can be a lot more malicious than a cursed supernatural entity. Ideas like that make Tumbbad a real mind-bender and the film's top-notch production design makes it a movie that truly reinvents the horror genre for Indian cinema.\\nThe film kicks off with a CGI sequence of gods and goddesses and a strong allegory of the destructive nature of greed. Tumbbad, an actual village in Maharashtra, becomes the fabric of this tale. Tumbbad is a moody and atmospheric film.

      "[b'TUMBAAD is a highly engrossing movie and a Visual treat. Original Story amidst a backdrop of folklore makes Tumbbad a delight. Though watched it at its initial screening at the Venice festival but writing this review after re-watch again.Story about greed that start from an ancient treasure hidden in a mansion. The process of reaching to that wealth and the desire to grab more of it and in the process going to any extent. I\\'ll sum this movie in these couple of lines not giving the entire story and the plot. It has some Excellent background score and gripping screenplay. Does have some minor flaws that can be ignored. Overall, original story and folklore make it a worthy watch with a superlative effort from the actor and producer Soham Shah. Enjoy almost two hours of adventure with a seasoning of Horror and you will not be disappointed. Did read some weird reviews from critics mentioning it \" as an art film\" not for everybody and some even mentioning \" it has a lot of Marathi influence and Hindi speaking audience might not like it \" very sad Indeed. My request please do watch it.']\n",
